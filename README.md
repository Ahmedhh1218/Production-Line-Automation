# ProductionLineAutomation

## Description
ProductionLineAutomation is a comprehensive repository dedicated to streamlining and optimizing manufacturing processes through the integration of cutting-edge technology. With a focus on feeding, sorting, and storing, this project aims to revolutionize production lines by automating key tasks.

## Features
- Meticulous design of production line components using SOLIDWORKS.
- Simulation of integrated processes using MATLAB Simscape and Simulink Libraries.
- Stress analysis and actuator sizing calculations for robustness and reliability.
- Real-time monitoring and control of automated processes with RTOS-based programming and microcontroller communication via Ethernet.

## Repository Structure
- `/design`: Contains the SOLIDWORKS files for the designed production line components.
- `/simulations`: Includes MATLAB simulation files for testing and validating the integrated processes.
- `/analysis`: Provides stress analysis reports and actuator sizing calculations.
- `/programming`: Contains the codebase for the RTOS-based programming and microcontroller communication.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ProductionLineAutomation.git`
2. Review the design files in the `/design` directory.
3. Run the MATLAB simulations in the `/simulations` directory to validate the integrated processes.
4. Analyze stress reports and actuator sizing calculations in the `/analysis` directory.
5. Explore the `/programming` directory for the RTOS-based programming and microcontroller communication code.
